# Political and Peace Data Analysis

This repository contains two R scripts analyzing political and peace-related metrics across various countries and regions.

## Script 1: Political Polarization and Ideology Analysis (2023)

This script explores relationships between poverty, unemployment rate, and political polarization measured by the Dalton Polarization Index.  
- **DaltonPolarization**: Index measuring how spread political parties are on the left-right spectrum (0 = all parties at the same point, 10 = parties at ideological extremes).  
- **CountryIdeology**: Metric of a country's typical ideology on a 0 (far left) to 10 (far right) scale.  
Data is analyzed for Greece, Hungary, and Italy, also separated by regions within each country.

## Script 2: Global Peace Index Prediction

This script develops a predictive model for the Global Peace Index (GPI) using data from 2023 across multiple countries.  
The goal is to identify key factors influencing peace levels globally.

Both analyses were done as academic projects for the Master in Geopolitics and Strategic Studies at University Carlos III of Madrid. The research tries to uncover meaningful patterns in political and social datasets.
